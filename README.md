# Webpack Dependency Graph Visualizer

## What is it

 * webpack [stats.json](https://webpack.js.org/api/stats) parser/converter for visual/UI dependencies analysis
 * [configurable](./deps.config.ts) filters: exclude, except, include, max deps count
 * output formats:
    * [graphml](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) graph for proprietary [yed](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download) editor
    * [DOT](https://github.com/glejeune/node-graphviz) graph
    * `*.png` [cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) graph export
    * json debug data

## Caveats

 * terminology:
    * webpack `module`: dependencies, source in graph
	* webpack `reason(origin)`: consumer, destination in graph
 * dependency map calculated only for nodes with dependencies. For the dot format it's ok, but for the graphml bunch of nodes added from the dependencies array
 * see the full path in node data properties(right click)
    * ![](./doc/graphml_yed_data.jpg)
 * search in nodes, urls, properties
    * ![](./doc/graphml_yed_search.jpg)
 * Exporting one dependency in multiple files can be confusing
    * ![](./doc/graphml_re-export_code.jpg)
    * ![](./doc/graphml_key_properties.jpg)
 * Graph node label consist of file name only, so if you see similar names, you can right-click it and check the properties-->data tab to see the full path

    * ![](./doc/graphml_index_properties_2.jpg)
    * ![](./doc/graphml_index_properties_3.jpg)
 * You can enable edge labeling and coloring to check similar dependencies origins

## Examples

Generating graphml and editing it in [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download) are the best option for now. Best yEd layouts: circular(alt+shift+c), hierarchical(alt+shift+h).

The graphviz layout renderer seems to be less useful. You can upload the simplified dot file into any [graphviz editor](http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/) and try to play with settings.

## What is it for

 * Refactoring decision making helper
 * addition tool for the [code analysis methodic](https://github.com/bskydive/code_quality_js)
 * Detect a circular dependency in a large monorepo project.
 * Figure out where the module is being used, imported and exported from.
 * Analyze why webpack cannot tree-shake a particular module or dependency from the chunk.

## How to run

 * set the [config](./deps.config.js) params
 * optionally use [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to choose node@16+
 * execute in console
    ```bash
        nvm i 16 # optionally
        npm i
        cp ${your_project_folder}/stats.json ./webpack-dep-graph/webpack-stats.json
        npm run start
        
    ```
